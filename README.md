# PSL Minified
A minified version of the Public Suffix List.

## Pulling the file
You can pull the file from [https://psl-min.hrsn.dev/list/public_suffix_list.min.dat](https://psl-min.hrsn.dev/list/public_suffix_list.min.dat).

We also have the original file the minified version is generated from, which is published [here](https://psl-min.hrsn.dev/list/public_suffix_list.dat), just so you can have peace of mind we have not modified the any rules from the original list. You can see the minifying script [here](https://github.com/wdhdev/psl-min/blob/main/scripts/minify.js).

The minified version of the PSL is automatically updated every 24 hours.
