# PSL Minified
A project with the goal of minifying the PSL for projects that want a smaller copy of public_suffix_list.dat.

**This project is NOT associated with the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org). It is a community-run project.**

> [!NOTE]
> We do not modify the PSL in any way, we simply remove the comments from the original file. You can see the minifying script [here](scripts/minify.js).

## Pulling the file
You can pull the file from [https://psl-min.hrsn.dev/list/public_suffix_list.min.dat](https://psl-min.hrsn.dev/list/public_suffix_list.min.dat)
